# Bloomreach Discovery Item Builder

This variable template is a no-code solution to create the correct object to use in the Bloomreach Discovery pageview tags to send data from GTM to Bloomreach about e-commerce products.
The structure is setup to work with the GA4 data structure out of the box. However, if you have a different array with e-commerce objects, you can assign the array and variable names you want to map to Bloomreach.
